**Quantification of a document's contents and meanings**

- Can we *quantitatively infer* the contents and meanings of a document by looking at the *words* that make up the document?

- Does the frequency of a word, called *term frequency* (i.e., how frequently a word occurs in a document), express how importance this word is in a document (thus providing an insight into the author's intention when using that word).

- How do you account for frequently used words (e.g., the, is, of ...)?

- 


```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).
